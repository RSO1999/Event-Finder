# Event-Finder

This SwiftUI application allows users to browse and search for popular events in their city using the [Ticketmaster Discovery API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/).

> ðŸš¨ **Note:** The API key has been removed for security. You'll need your own Ticketmaster API key to run this project.
